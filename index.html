    <h1>The Digital Collective Unconscious</h1>
    <p class ="paragraph">
      Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious proposes that there is a layer within our unconscious mind that is comprised 
      of knowledge and iconography that is shared amongst all of humanity that is inherited from birth. For instance, across every culture 
      there is a universal idea of what a mother or maternal figure may be, commonly shared phobias such as the unknown or the dark, and an 
      idea of what good and evil are. On an individual level, we are the sum of these shared ideas, however we invariably contribute and add 
      to these collective concepts, causing perpetual growth and change. While a literal interpretation of inheriting these concepts
      through genetics is within the realm of pseudoscience, the symbolic interpretation has arguably become reality. When thinking 
      of the collective unconscious as a database or comparing it to cloud computing, it's almost analogous to the internet and social media.
