    <h1>The Digital Collective Unconscious</h1>
    <p class ="paragraph">
      <b>Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious proposes that there is a layer within our unconscious mind that is comprised 
      of knowledge and iconography that is shared amongst all of humanity that is inherited from birth.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, across every culture there is a universal idea of what a mother or maternal figure may be, commonly shared phobias such 
      as the unknown or the dark, and an idea of what good and evil are. On an individual level, we are the sum of these shared ideas, however we invariably contribute and add 
      to these collective concepts, causing perpetual growth and change. While a literal interpretation of inheriting these concepts
      through genetics is within the realm of pseudoscience, the symbolic interpretation has arguably become reality. When thinking 
      of the collective unconscious as a database or comparing it to cloud computing, it's almost analogous to the internet and social media. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The world wide web has eroded borders between people. In this virtual domain, no one is segregated by geography by geography or social-economic status. 
      Social media interconnects us, allowing complete strangers to share experiences and pass down concepts or memes. This collectively shared pool of 
      knowledge is more than a communication hub. Nothing here is forgotten, everything added to the amalgam known as the internet will mold and influence 
      future cultures and humanity as a whole.

    <h1>Psychological Contagions</h1>
    <p class ="paragraph">
      <b>In 1976, biologist Richard Dawkins published a book on evolution titled The Selfish Gene. In the last chapter of the book, the word “meme”  
        and the idea of what they are is introduced. Memes from the perspective of biology are styles, behaviors, and concepts that are spread between individuals.</b>
    </p>
      <p>
        Think of the latest craze sweeping the campus, fashion trends, slang, or a popular single playing on the radio. These memes invariably spread throughout their
        culture, then go on to mutate into new variations, almost like a virus. To Dawkins, these cultural transmissions were the equivalent to a gene, passed down 
        and altered from one generation to the next. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple decades later, the early internet would be introduced, allowing people from across the world to interact with one another virtually on message boards 
        or email. In this context, the word meme was applied to internet discourse. Online groups and forums became conducive to propagating memes quickly as they had 
        large and diverse user bases and encouraged communication. Videos, text, and images could be posted, and rapidly altered as they are shared across the web. 
        This virtual phenomenon would only continue escalate as search engines and social networks allowed for even more ways to spread information. Even if these 
        memes spread on a micro scale, their impact can be observed on the macro, molding ideologies and social norms.
